			<h4>Dear Richard Horton,</h4>
<p>In 1998 you wrote, <em>“When the state of the health of the people is at stake, we should be prepared to take action to diminish these risks even when the scientific knowledge is not conclusive.”</em> [1]</p>
<p>Nothing is proven to work against COVID-19, because it is a new virus. But vitamin C has worked against every single virus including influenzas, pneumonia, and even poliomyelitis. Intravenous vitamin C works in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, as in all forms of sepsis [2]. Reports are starting to confirm that it does so in Covid-19 induced ARDS. Both effects are dose-dependent.</p>
<p>Vitamin D also protects against respiratory infections and mitigates ARDS [3]. Both effects are stronger in those who are vitamin D deficient, which at this time of year is most of us.</p>
<p>The Orthomolecular News Service has been reporting on this for 2 months now.  All the scientific data is available on their website [4].</p>
<p>Yet governments call for “robust evidence”, and Facebook blocks postings reporting this, while people die preventable deaths. Our frontline colleagues are at particular risk. By acting now we can save health workers’ lives.</p>
<p>Will you please call on the government to take the following steps immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognise these facts and inform the public</li>
<li>Factor these nutrients into the public health measures now in place</li>
<li>Ensure supply of Vitamin C in particular by increasing production and distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr Damien Downing MBBS  MRSB
President, British Society for Ecological Medicine</p>

		<h3>What we do</h3>
		<p>
			Using medical history, examination and specialised laboratory
			investigations, we assess nutritional status, toxic exposures,
			metabolic and immune function, and plan treatment of the
			problems identified.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our standard of care is therefore not based on diagnosis. For
			example in epilepsy your GP or consultant would prescribe
			anticonvulsant therapy; we would seek to identify and correct
			the causes, in nutrition, toxicity and metabolic disorder.
			Treatment usually comprises diets, nutritional supplements and
			detoxification procedures, administered both by mouth and by
			injection. We also offer desensitisation injections for allergies.

						<p>Over the past 30 years we have been living through an epidemic of allergies and autoimmune diseases (and cancers). Our genes cannot have changed enough to account for this; the one thing that could explain all three and which has changed dramatically is our environment; levels of environmental pollution only go up, never down.</p>

						<p>Throughout 2017 I kept saying &quot;This looks like the year that the whole fat-cholesterol-heart disease hypothesis falls apart.&quot; Well for once it looks like I was right.
