			<p>From Monday January 4th 2021 Dr Damien Downing and Nutrition Associates Ltd will be working in new premises at:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hale Clinic, 4 Harley St, London W1G 9PB</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three years of close association between Nutrition Associates and The Elixir Clinic are finally coming to an end. Elixir are moving to new premises where they are unable to offer me suitable accommodation. My clinic at 75 Wimpole St will therefore cease on 23rd December, and as from 4th January we will be operating from The Hale Clinic.</p>
<p>I make this announcement with some sadness. The pandemic has forced difficult decisions on many of us, and this is one of them. Elixir are having to reconfigure their business without us, but there are no hard feelings, we wish them well and hope there will be interactions and cooperations for years to come.</p>
<p>All our phone numbers and email addresses are remaining the same; our postal address will change shortly to Hale Clinic as well. The good news is that we will have an office and a physical presence there.</p>
<p>We are collaborating with The Hale Clinic on setting up a nursing service that will do all our injected treatments, and our blood-taking.</p>
<p>The new premises are at the south end (Oxford Circus end) of Harley St, only 250 yards from the Wimpole St address. There is a wheelchair ramp, an elevator and a disabled toilet.</p>
<p>We are trying to notify anybody who has an appointment in January, but if you are at all worried do please call us on 07718 483484. We are doing our best to ensure that there will be no inconvenience to you at all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, A Very Happy Christmas to you and yours.</p>

					We offer medical advice and treatments based on the principles

					consequences:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>INPUTS:</b> the impact of nutritional and environmental factors on the individual</li>
					<li><b>PROCESSING:</b> the way we handle inputs and how that determines our health</li>

		<h3>What we do</h3>
		<p>
			Using medical history, examination and specialised laboratory
			investigations, we assess nutritional status, toxic exposures,
			metabolic and immune function, and plan treatment of the
			problems identified.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our standard of care is therefore not based on diagnosis. For
			example in epilepsy your GP or consultant would prescribe
			anticonvulsant therapy; we would seek to identify and correct
			the causes, in nutrition, toxicity and metabolic disorder.
			Treatment usually comprises diets, nutritional supplements and
			detoxification procedures, administered both by mouth and by
			injection. We also offer desensitisation injections for allergies.

						<p>Over the past 30 years we have been living through an epidemic of allergies and autoimmune diseases (and cancers). Our genes cannot have changed enough to account for this; the one thing that could explain all three and which has changed dramatically is our environment; levels of environmental pollution only go up, never down.</p>
