<h1>We are moving</h1>
</header>

<article class="main content">
<p>From Monday January 4th 2021 Dr Damien Downing and Nutrition Associates Ltd will be working in new premises at:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hale Clinic, 4 Harley St, London W1G 9PB</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three years of close association between Nutrition Associates and The Elixir Clinic are finally coming to an end. Elixir are moving to new premises where they are unable to offer me suitable accommodation. My clinic at 75 Wimpole St will therefore cease on 23rd December, and as from 4th January we will be operating from The Hale Clinic.</p>
<p>I make this announcement with some sadness. The pandemic has forced difficult decisions on many of us, and this is one of them. Elixir are having to reconfigure their business without us, but there are no hard feelings, we wish them well and hope there will be interactions and cooperations for years to come.</p>
<p>All our phone numbers and email addresses are remaining the same; our postal address will change shortly to Hale Clinic as well. The good news is that we will have an office and a physical presence there.</p>
<p>We are collaborating with The Hale Clinic on setting up a nursing service that will do all our injected treatments, and our blood-taking.</p>
<p>The new premises are at the south end (Oxford Circus end) of Harley St, only 250 yards from the Wimpole St address. There is a wheelchair ramp, an elevator and a disabled toilet.</p>
<p>We are trying to notify anybody who has an appointment in January, but if you are at all worried do please call us on 07718 483484. We are doing our best to ensure that there will be no inconvenience to you at all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, A Very Happy Christmas to you and yours.</p>
