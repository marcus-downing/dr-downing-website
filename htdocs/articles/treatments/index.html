<h1>Treatments</h1>
</header>

<article class="main content">
<p>A word of warning; when you are sick, and sometimes desperate, it is easy to latch on to one thing that you hope may fix things for you. This rarely works. 30 years in the business have taught me to always think integratively. If your problem was that simple you would not have found your way to me, because someone or something would have fixed it before. Please don’t be disappointed therefore when we say that we cannot guarantee that you will receive a particular treatment, and that you will always need a proper medical assessment before we prescribe. This is also what the law says; I cannot prescribe you a medication without examining and assessing you.</p>
<p>And please note that we rarely use the word “cure” – it can mean so many very different things.</p>
<p>The main principles of our treatment are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Detoxify</li>
<li>Nourish</li>
<li>Desensitise</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people need all 3 of these.</p>
<h2>Detoxify</h2>
<p>There are a number of different methods of detoxing on the market, from the shop-bought and self-administered to medical intravenous ones. Some are worthless, some are likely to be inappropriate for you, some can be dangerous. The mainstay of our treatment is the Phospholipid Exchange Therapy (PLX), which we know to be safe, and which is always individually-prescribed. We monitor its effectiveness with regular lab tests.</p>
<p>PLX is a technique that has been practised for some decades, especially in Eastern Europe, using a purified oil product, Phosphatidylcholine, by intravenous injection, by mouth and now also by retention enema. There is an extensive literature on its safety and efficacy in a wide range of disorders including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease, liver damage, kidney failure,and auto-immune diseases.</p>
<p>The technique is similar to (but more targeted and precise than) Lipid Rescue, a technique used by anaesthesiologists and in the ER, of which a review in 2012 said;
It is surprising that such a simple formulation, lipid emulsion, can rapidly reverse severe clinical toxicity from a variety of vastly diverse medications with distinct pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of action.</p>
<p>Alongside the intravenous therapy (even, if unavoidable, instead of it) we use oral supplements of lipids (nutritional fats and oils) and in particular Phosphatidylcholine.</p>
<p>An important dietary technique, a means of reducing exposure to toxins and strengthening the system, is a Ketogenic Diet. This is a diet that is very low in carbohydrates (not just free of added sugars, but with very little glucose, fructose or complex carbohydrates) AND high in lipids. It is not a calorie-restriction diet – it is the addition of the lipids (fats and oils) that makes it work; work to lose weight, work to stimulate the gall-bladder, to repair cells, boost metabolism, even to assist in cancer therapy.</p>
<p>There are several additional techniques we can offer to help you make a Ketogenic Diet work, including oral lipids and an advanced protein supplement, and if necessary we can even supply a blood meter for glucose and ketones to make sure you are getting it right.</p>
<h2>Nourish</h2>
<p>It is usual for the digestion to be a contributing factor in health problems – often the key to it in fact. If this sounds right for you, you might want to start by reading my 2014 book The Vitamin Cure for Digestive Disease, co-authored with nutritional therapist and nurse Anne Pemberton. It contains practical advice for a range of digestive problems. We have it in stock.</p>
<p>The Ketogenic Diet is also a good starting point for a nourishing diet. It can easily be made completely gluten-free as well. The laboratory tests (all of them) provide information on particular nutrients that need to be supplemented.</p>
<p>Nobody these days can afford to forget we now call the microbiome - the organisms that live on and in you, particularly in the gut. Probiotic therapy is a key treatment, and there have been exciting advances in this.</p>
<h2>Desensitise</h2>
<p>I have used desensitisation therapy for over 30 years, starting with EPD – the Enzyme Potentiated Desensitisation technique developed at St Mary’s Hospital in the 1960s. More recently I switched to the almost-identical LDA form. In October 2014 at a conference in Albuquerque there were major developments in our understanding of and use of desensitisation; we now realise that it can do much more.</p>
<p>Disease conditions that now appear to be treatable in this way include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allergies of all types including inhalant allergies (eczema/asthma/hay fever) food intolerances and chemical sensitivities</li>
<li>Autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, autoimmune arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune thyroiditis, and some forms of psoriasis</li>
<li>Post-infective problems such as Post-Viral Fatigue Syndrome, chronic Lyme disease, Crohn’s disease</li>
<li>Complex and previously unexplained problems such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, ulcerative colitis, endometriosis, sarcoidosis.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Please, always remember one crucial thing</h2>
<p>Do not put all your eggs in one basket; many people need all 3 of the treatment approaches described above, perhaps also medications or surgery. If you are hoping for a quick fix or a “magic bullet” you are likely to be disappointed.</p>
<p>Also, I work as part of an integrative team alongside specialists in physical and psychological therapies. We divide the modalities loosely into another set of 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mind</li>
<li>Muscle</li>
<li>Metabolism</li>
</ul>
<p>The third one is mine; often I recommend people take advantage of the other two. Attention to breathing in particular can yield real benefits – it is the only readily accessible way into our bodily rhythms and cycles. My colleagues specialise in this area, and these days there are various devices and even apps that can help you.</p>
