<p>“In September I was diagnosed with early Parkinson’s disease. As a fit 60-something this came as quite a blow. Dr Downing quickly started me on both oral and injected nutrient therapy.</p>
<p>So far I have only had 6 injections, but already I’ve felt dramatic improvements. The numbness and the pins and needles have almost gone; my walking is better and I have more energy and strength; I can now do things again that I had lost, like holding a fork and brushing my hair; I’m sleeping better, and I’ve even got back my sense of smell which had been gone for several years!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In medical school, many years ago, they taught me that “the brain is a fatty organ”. It’s true; nerve cells have long axons, thin extensions leading to the connections with other cells (synapses). The axons are covered in cell membrane, made up of 90-something percent lipids (fats/oils), and there’s a lot of surface for the internal volume. So nervous systems are vulnerable to both a lack of, and damage to, their membrane lipids.</p>
<p>That’s why with all neurological and psychological symptoms we tend to assume there is a Starved Brain. The first thing to do for that is to feed the nerve cells – with the lipids they need for their structure, and all the nutrients, vitamins, minerals, amino acids and lipids, they need for normal, healthy functioning.</p>
<p>The next thing to do is detox the cells. These days we are all exposed to steadily increasing levels of environmental pollutants – WWF estimated that the average person takes in every week enough plastic to make a credit card. We are having to detox all the time, but for some people it is harder work, for reasons that may include genetic, nutritional, immune, and stress-related.</p>
<p>You may have already needed medication for the symptoms of such diseases, but you can still benefit from appropriate nutritional and ecological therapies.</p>
