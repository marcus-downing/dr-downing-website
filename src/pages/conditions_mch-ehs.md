title: Multiple chemical sensitivity and electromagnetic hypersensitivity
---

Around 5% of people report Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), but in one way they are the lucky ones because they detect the poisons early and can take steps to avoid them. The rest of us just keep getting poisoned. Desensitisation can certainly help with chemical sensitivities, but it also takes targetted nutrition and detoxification, plus reducing your exposure.

Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EHS or ES) is a growing problem, set to get worse with the roll-out of 5G, but the evidence clearly shows that existing levels of EMFs are harmful to humans, to animals, to all biological systems in fact. You can see more about this in the Consensus Statement on Non-Ionising Radiation on the BSEM website.

An important lesson we have learnt about EHS and MCS is that it’s not black and white, not binary. You don’t need to be, and probably can’t be perfect; all reductions in exposure and all improvements in nutrition and lifestyle are worth doing. If you get a good night’s sleep in a “clean” environment for instance, that is well worth doing.
