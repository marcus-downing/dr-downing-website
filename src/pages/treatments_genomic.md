We are all exposed to multiple toxins from the environment; why does it only make some people sick? Often the answer is in their genomics, the minor alterations in genes that can determine our capacity to detox, for example. Why can infections like Lyme cause devastating diseases in some people but not others? Same answer.

I have been using genomic data for 16 years now, and while it does not explain everything, it is a valuable additional layer of information and understanding, which can help in selecting treatment modalities. For 3 years now the lab of choice has been excellent British start-up Lifecode. Their list of panels is updated frequently, and so far includes the key areas of Methylation, Detoxification, Oestrogen Balance, Histamine, Neurotransmitters, APOE, Thyroid Health, Nutrient Core and Athletic Performance.
