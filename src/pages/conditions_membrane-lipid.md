title: Membrane lipids and lipid therapy

For more than a decade now I have worked with Dr Patricia Kane (and previously her late husband Ed) in the USA; between them they know more about lipids than anyone in the world. They have helped me to understand these most complex structures. Lipids (fats and oils) used to be dismissed as the “worthless, greasy stuff”, but actually they are the secret to life. Many people have realised their importance and try to support them with supplements, but this is a complex area and it is easy to get mixed up.

We use laboratory assessment of lipids to find the way forward – assessment of both the essential, nutritional lipids and those damaged by toxins or infections.
