> "In September I was diagnosed with early Parkinson’s disease. As a fit 60-something this came as quite a blow. Dr Downing quickly started me on both oral and injected nutrient therapy. So far I have only had 6 injections, but already I’ve felt dramatic improvements. The numbness and the pins and needles have almost gone; my walking is better and I have more energy and strength; I can now do things again that I had lost, like holding a fork and brushing my hair; I’m sleeping better, and I’ve even got back my sense of smell which had been gone for several years!"
