I am not a cancer specialist, and I cannot replace your oncologist and/or surgeon. Nor do I have the training or qualifications to tell them what to do. What I can offer you if you have a diagnosis of cancer is best described as adjunctive nutritional and metabolic support. That may include specific nutrients at high doses, including:

- Vitamin C orally and sometimes intravenously
- Phospholipid therapy orally and intravenously 
- Amino acids orally in high doses
- Vitamin D3, Vitamin K2, Chondroitin
- B vitamins and coenzyme Q10  (with care in regard to folic acid)
- Zinc and minerals (care needed to avoid risk of adverse effects)

Always it will include diet advice too. [Here is the document I give to anybody who asks what to do about their cancer](/articles/nutritional-support-cancer/).

We always seek to work with your NHS or equivalent oncology team as far as possible. We believe that the treatment of cancer should always be integrative, combining the best possible orthodox, nutritional and complementary therapies.
