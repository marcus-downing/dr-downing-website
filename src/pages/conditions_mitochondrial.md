title: Mitochondrial dysfunction
---

We have been focussing on mitochondrial health and function for almost 20 years now, assisted by cutting-edge laboratories. Mitochondria are influenced by all the nutrients and pollutants that course through our system, and by just about everything else that goes on in our bodies and minds.

Three studies by John Maclaren Howard, Dr Sarah Myhill and Norman Booth clearly show that people with Chronic Fatigue syndrome (CFS) have problems in their mitochondria. So that’s where we start, with blood tests to look at the mitochondria and other aspects of cell function. Then we think about all those potential causes – infections, toxic exposures and so on, using your history and any past laboratory findings to prioritise them.
