PLX is a technique that has been practised for some decades, especially in Eastern Europe, using a purified oil product, Phosphatidylcholine, by intravenous injection and/or by mouth - and now also by retention enema. There is an extensive literature on its safety and efficacy in a wide range of disorders including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease, liver damage, kidney failure,and auto-immune diseases.

The technique is similar to (but more targeted and precise than) Lipid Rescue, a technique used by anaesthesiologists and in the ER, of which a review in 2012 said;

> “It is surprising that such a simple formulation, lipid emulsion, can rapidly reverse severe clinical toxicity from a variety of vastly diverse medications with distinct pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of action.”
