title: Should I have the Covid vaccine?
---

Short answer: I can’t tell you what to do, and nor can the prescribing doctor, but if you do, take lots of vitamin C, and if you don’t, still take vitamin C.

Last week the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine were given, and 48 hours later there were already reports of two serious (“anaphylactoid”) allergic reactions in recipients. Authorities are now advising that the vaccine should not be given to people with “significant” known allergies. I take the view that if you consulted me about your allergies they must have been “significant”. And yes, I would include auto-immune reactions in that, and probably any chronic inflammatory conditions for which we don’t have a cause. Chronic fatigue syndrome? Less clear; allergies certainly can play a part in it.

If you would feel safer having the vaccine, then read this article first: [Vitamin C Prevents Vaccination Side Effects; Increases Effectiveness](http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v08n07.shtml). Or if children are involved read this one: [Don't Vaccinate without Vitamin C](http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v11n09.shtml)

You should also know that the GMC recently sent all doctors an update to their guidelines on consent to tests or treatments, which makes it clear that any doctor has a duty to inform you about the risks from any treatment, and about reasonable alternatives. Frankly this makes it pretty hard for a GP to know all the issues and tick all the boxes. Which is why a newly-formed group, the UK Medical Freedom Alliance, has put together [this Covid-19 vaccine consent form and info sheet](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa5866942937a4d73918723/5fcccc0fb2087f907e58ea30_UKMFA_CV19_vaccine_consent_form_v2.pdf). It is quite in depth and detailed, but if you are taking control of your own health I recommend it.

I have not signed up to the [UKMFA](https://www.ukmedfreedom.org/) simply because I have plenty to do already with the [BSEM](bsem.org.uk) and [OMNS](orthomolecular.org) that has kept me busy all year. I certainly don’t disapprove of what they say and I’m happy to inform you of them.

But the virus is still going around, so my advice still stands; vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc. Just keep taking them.
